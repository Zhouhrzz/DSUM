## DSUM: Dual-stage Uncertainty Modeling for Unsupervised Cross-domain 3D Model Retrieval
Dual-stage Uncertainty Modeling for Unsupervised Cross-domain 3D Model Retrieval
## Introduction
We propose a novel dual-stage uncertainty modeling method for unsupervised cross-domain 3D model retrieval, which utilizes probability distributions to effectively capture uncertainties in both sample and class representations, arising from variations in sample views and within-class diversity.
## Requirements
- Linux
- Python >= 3.7
- PyTorch == 1.7.1
- CUDA (must be a version supported by the pytorch version)
